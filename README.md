# GOCAMPING
GOCAMPING is a single-page responsive app. It is a clone of Hipcamp, which is a site to browse and book camping grounds.

The technlogies used to create CampAway include: React, Redux, PostgresSQL, Ruby on Rails, AWS, Google Maps API, HTML5, and CSS3.

#FEATURES

#USER AUTH

Users are able to create accounts, login and logout using the authentication system, which was created using BCrypty on a rails backend. Users can also login as a demo user so that they can easily browse the site.

#Host a Site

Users are able to create their own camping ground by filling out a form. The form was rendered using React and gives the impression of being 3 pages, where it is actually one component. This effect was achieved by using React fragment. Users can choose from various camp features to illustrate what their site offers. Once a user has created a site, they are then able to delete it as well.

#Future Plans

In the future, I hope to optimize page load speeds as well as implement a user's profile page.
